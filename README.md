# Paris Taxi Fare
Prototype build with React for a Taxi company intended to display taxi journeys and calculate the price for each ride.

Each ride is displayed in a simple box showing the ride's ID and the ride's price. After clicking on a ride's box, 
an alert pops out displaying the ride's duration and its end time, after closing the alert, the ride component should have the 
word "CLICKED" beside the ID.

Rides which traveled more than 2 miles have their box background color in red.

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`
